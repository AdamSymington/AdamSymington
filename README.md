### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Professional github account, for my personal and academic projects see https://github.com/symmy596

My name is Adam Symington, a data scientist and programmer. During my academic career I used ab initio and classical simulation techniques to predict and analyse the properties batteries, fuel cells, catalysts and nuclear fuel. In addition to research, I have taught several undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Bath, introducing students to Python programming and it's application in the chemical sciences.
Now I work as a data scientist at Geollect ltd. We are a geospatial inteligence company specialising in the marine sector. I develop the backend for our vessel tracking software, use machine learning to predict the behaviour of ships at sea and use data to investigate the illegal activities of ships.
